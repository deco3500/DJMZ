# DJMZ

# Introduction:
**DJMZ** will be creating a mobile compatible web application to deliver local news within a userâ€™s vicinity using a visual map. It will covering both formal and informal news. It aims to address the lack of channel for news that affect people locally. Often times, news are in a global/state level, where consumers do not feel a direct impact to these events. 

# Concept:
 This application will be covering some common categories: local events (will cover all the general news), food (covers all food realted news such as supermarket discount, new restaurant opening and so on), crime(will be cover all crime related news), transportation (will be covering news related to traffic, buses, trains and so on).
 
 The main target audience will be for young people (30 years of age and below) that have grown accustomed to smartphone and GPS technology.
 
 The uniqueness of the application is that it is a fusion between user-submitted content and geographically tagged news content.

- **Debbie** will be in charge of team deliverables submission and sets agenda for group meetings. Will set up the development environment for the team and assist in member issues. Represents the team when communicating with tutors/lecturer. Secondary back-end developer specializing on the spatial functions in the project.
- **Miral** will keep track of team deliverable due dates and follows up with individual tasks assigned to each member.
- **Jin** will focus on the content on the web application and participate on the back-end development. Also will give out help on front-end developement as well. 

# Communications:
- **Github** -  File sharing, group submissions, code sharing
- **FB Group** - Group announcements, discussions, task reminders
- **Workshops** - Decision voting, In-person discussions, presentations
- **Google Drive** - Document collaboration
- **Email** - For formal communication
- **Phone/SMS** - For emergencies

# Decision making:
The group will make decisions as a majority vote. In the case of consistent equal votes, by chance of randomness, a member of the group will have to forfeit their vote.

# Poor communication / contribution:
#### In the case of poor communication or contributions, our group will have a **3 strikes system**. Should a group member:
- Not communicate of their status of work/attendance on consecutive separate days
- Not deliver tasks on time without valid reasons (unexpected bugs/glitches/problems)
- The subject matter will be raised to tutors/lecturers with substantial evidence of effort to contact/reach/obtain contribution.

# Plan:
**Project phases**: 
The project phases are divided into four main steps, Proposal, Design, Feature-based Prototype, Overall Prototype. The proposal phase is where the direction of the project is decided. While this phase it is important to do a background research of the problem space and apply the initial feedback. The design of the web application is the most crucial first step of the project as the better design would speed up the front-end workload. The next phase is feature-based prototype meaning the app would be broken down into major features and will be developed individually. During this phase it is required to have one set of code guide to avoid unnecessary clashes of features developed by different developers. The final stage is to put together all the individual features into one whole prototype. This step would require a greater care as many things would definitely break and causes unintentional bugs. 

**Deliverables**:
- Project Documentation
- User Interface Design
- Database
- Web services

**Resources**:
- Bootstrap framework
- Google maps API
- Photoshop
- php

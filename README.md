# DJMZ

# Introduction:
DJMZ will be creating a mobile compatible web application to deliver local news within a userâ€™s vicinity using a visual map. It aims to address the lack of channel for news that affect people locally. Often times, news are in a global/state level, where consumers do not feel a direct impact to these events. 

Concept:
The main target audience will be for young people (30 years of age and below) that have grown accustomed to smartphone and GPS technology. The uniqueness of the application is a fusion between user-submitted content and geographically tagged news content.

Team:
Debbie Sanchez (Team Leader, Back-end Development)

Communications:
Github -  File sharing, group submissions, code sharing
FB Group - Group announcements, discussions, task reminders
Workshops - Decision voting, In-person discussions, presentations
Google Drive - Document collaboration

Decision making:
The group will make decisions as a majority vote. In the case of consistent equal votes, by chance of randomness, a member of the group will have to forfeit their vote.


Poor communication / contribution:
In the case of poor communication or contributions, our group will have a 3 strikes system. Should a group member:
Not communicate of their status of work/attendance on consecutive separate days
Not deliver tasks on time without valid reasons (unexpected bugs/glitches/problems)
The subject matter will be raised to tutors/lecturers with substantial evidence of effort to contact/reach/obtain contribution.

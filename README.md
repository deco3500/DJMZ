## Introduction:
Most people that like to go out at night with their friends would appreciate an easy way to obtain information about their friend’s proximity, events happening in nearby pubs/clubs/bars, drink price discounts (happy hour) and most importantly efficiently organizing group gatherings. Moreover, most local AND national news channels only focus on giving out information on major and popular businesses events instead of those happening within the vicinity of the consumers. They also lack in fulfilling social aspects like organizing group gatherings that is more important for people who like to do party with their friends.

**DJMZ** has created a mobile compatible web application (Night Pigeon) which focuses on providing information of events happening in pubs/clubs/bars within the user’s vicinity. It aims to address the lack of channel for news that affect people locally. Often times, news are in a global/state level, where consumers do not feel a direct impact to these events happening nearby pubs/clubs/bars. 

**Night Pigeon** offers certain functionalities to address above mentioned news dilemma.
It allow users to see events happening around them using their phone’s GPS (by clicking tags on visual map).
User can see different events like good music, cheaper, expensive, crowded, uncrowded by different tags on the map.
User can search events happening around them within user’s set time (e.g 5 mins, 10 mins).
Users can post events with different categories.
Users are able to get badge counts based on their posts.
Users can manage their profile.
Users can invite their friends to events.
Users can accept or deny the invitations.
 
The main **target audience** will be for young people (18+ years of age) who have grown accustomed to smartphone and GPS technology, and also like to do nightouts with their friends.
 
The uniqueness of the application is that, it is a fusion between user-submitted events and geographically tagged events. Moreover, it allows users to invite their friends for specific events and also allows them to search events based on time.

## Project Plan & Phases:

### Standup Milestones

| When?        | What?          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Week 8      | The overall design of the app's skelton using Photoshop and HTML/CSS  |
| Week 10     | The prototypes of different features in the app using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and PHP    |
| Week 12 |  The Final product/prototype of all features combined     |

### The project phases 
Phases are divided into four main steps: Proposal, Design, Feature-based Prototype, Overall Prototype. The proposal phase is where the direction of the project is decided. While this phase it is important to do a background research of the problem space and apply the initial feedback. The design of the web application is the most crucial first step of the project as the better design would speed up the front-end workload. The next phase is feature-based prototype meaning the app would be broken down into major features and will be developed individually. During this phase it is required to have one set of code guide to avoid unnecessary clashes of features developed by different developers. The final stage is to put together all the individual features into one whole prototype. This step would require a greater care as many things would definitely break and causes unintentional bugs. 

### Deliverables:
Each phase will have specific deliverables to be demonstrated in order for us or others to assess the milestone. Proposal phase will result a proposal of our project. This will set the basis of the project and give us the chance to outline what the project is going to be. The design phase will produce a number of different designs for the UI of the application and a series of questions for the user-testing. During the phase, the overall colour scheme will be decided and the UI will be tested for the best user experience. Feature-based prototype phase will create a number of prototypes depending on the number of unique features in the application and a series of questions for the user-testing. Each feature will be thoroughly tested and improved according to the feedback. Final deliverable for the project is overall prototype and user-testing questions. Here will have the final version of the project where all the features are combined. The final project will not be the final product but near there. 

### Resources:
There will be a number of resources that are being used to implement the application. For the quick and easier layout of the applcation, the team will utilize Bootstrap CSS framework. Also for any image/icon creation or editing will be done in Photoshop. Since the application will have a map and map pins to represent the user submitted events, the team has decided to use Google Maps API for its well-documented resources. Each team member will use their own computer for the project and code/files are shared through Google Drive and Github. Lastly, we also need people for the user testing for each phases.

## Communications:
- **Github** -  File sharing, group submissions, code sharing
- **FB Group** - Group announcements, discussions, task reminders
- **Workshops** - Decision voting, In-person discussions, presentations
- **Google Drive** - Document collaboration
- **Email** - For formal communication
- **Phone/SMS** - For emergencies

## Decision making:
The group will make decisions as a majority vote. In the case of consistent equal votes, by chance of randomness, a member of the group will have to forfeit their vote.

## Poor communication / contribution:
**In the case of poor communication or contributions, our group will have a 3 strikes system. Should a group member:**
- Not communicate of their status of work/attendance on consecutive separate days
- Not deliver tasks on time without valid reasons (unexpected bugs/glitches/problems)
- The subject matter will be raised to tutors/lecturers with substantial evidence of effort to contact/reach/obtain contribution.

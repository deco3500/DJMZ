## Introduction:
**DJMZ** will be creating a mobile compatible web application to deliver local news within a userâ€™s vicinity using a visual map. It will covering both formal and informal news. It aims to address the lack of channel for news that affect people locally. Often times, news are in a global/state level, where consumers do not feel a direct impact to these events. 

## Concept:
The application will allow users to share pictures, videos, and any other content under news domain of their local areas. These content that are shared will be taged on geographical map using the GPS on users devices. That is, the user can navigate through the map and find easily the news on their local areas just by clicking any tag sign around them. In addition, the application will be divided into some common categories: local events (will cover all the general news), food (covers all food realted news such as supermarket discount, new restaurant opening and so on), crime(will be cover all crime related news), transportation (will be covering news related to traffic, buses, trains and so on).
 
 The main **target audience** will be for young people (30 years of age and below) who have grown accustomed to smartphone and GPS technology.
 
 The uniqueness of the application is that it is a fusion between user-submitted content and geographically tagged news content. It is a platform where user can do both upload and read the news content at the same time.

|                   |                | **Debbie** will be in charge of team deliverables submission and sets agenda for group meetings. Will set up the development environment for the team and assist in member issues. Represents the team when communicating with tutors/lecturer. Secondary back-end developer specializing on the spatial functions in the project.|
| Miral Patel       | 43978281       | Front-end Development, Documentation, Time Keeper          |

|                   |                | **Zainab** will be in charge on: user testing, creating paper & electronic prototype, and developing the interactivity & design for the application |

## Communications:
- **Github** -  File sharing, group submissions, code sharing
- **FB Group** - Group announcements, discussions, task reminders
- **Workshops** - Decision voting, In-person discussions, presentations
- **Google Drive** - Document collaboration
- **Email** - For formal communication
- **Phone/SMS** - For emergencies

## Decision making:
The group will make decisions as a majority vote. In the case of consistent equal votes, by chance of randomness, a member of the group will have to forfeit their vote.

## Poor communication / contribution:
**In the case of poor communication or contributions, our group will have a 3 strikes system. Should a group member:**
- Not communicate of their status of work/attendance on consecutive separate days
- Not deliver tasks on time without valid reasons (unexpected bugs/glitches/problems)
- The subject matter will be raised to tutors/lecturers with substantial evidence of effort to contact/reach/obtain contribution.

## Project Plan:

### Project phases: 

#### Standup Milestones

| When?        | What?          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Week 8      | The overall design of the app's skelton using Photoshop and HTML/CSS  |
| Week 10     | The prototypes of different features in the app using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and PHP    |
| Week 12 |  The Final product/prototype of all features combined     |

#### The project phases 
Phases are divided into four main steps: Proposal, Design, Feature-based Prototype, Overall Prototype. The proposal phase is where the direction of the project is decided. While this phase it is important to do a background research of the problem space and apply the initial feedback. The design of the web application is the most crucial first step of the project as the better design would speed up the front-end workload. The next phase is feature-based prototype meaning the app would be broken down into major features and will be developed individually. During this phase it is required to have one set of code guide to avoid unnecessary clashes of features developed by different developers. The final stage is to put together all the individual features into one whole prototype. This step would require a greater care as many things would definitely break and causes unintentional bugs. 

#### Deliverables:
Each phase will have specific deliverables to be demonstrated in order for us or others to assess the milestone. Proposal phase will result a proposal of our project. This will set the basis of the project and give us the chance to outline what the project is going to be. The design phase will produce a number of different designs for the UI of the application and a series of questions for the user-testing. During the phase, the overall colour scheme will be decided and the UI will be tested for the best user experience. Feature-based prototype phase will create a number of prototypes depending on the number of unique features in the application and a series of questions for the user-testing. Each feature will be thoroughly tested and improved according to the feedback. Final deliverable for the project is overall prototype and user-testing questions. Here will have the final version of the project where all the features are combined. The final project will not be the final product but near there. 

#### Resources:
There will be a number of resources that are being used to implement the application. For the quick and easier layout of the applcation, the team will utilize Bootstrap CSS framework. Also for any image/icon creation or editing will be done in Photoshop. Since the application will have a map and map pins to represent the user submitted events, the team has decided to use Google Maps API for its well-documented resources. Each team member will use their own computer for the project and code/files are shared through Google Drive and Github. Lastly, we also need people for the user testing for each phases.
